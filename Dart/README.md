Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax

## Hello World

Every app has a main() function. To display text on the console, you can use the top-level print() function:

}
